        Dear Senator Young,
        <br>
        <br>
        I am a university student at Purdue University. I am writing to ask you to support S.4676, the Net Neutrality and Broadband Justice Act of 2022. The existence of net neutrality was a major factor in the explosive growth of the internet and Americaâ€™s online presence. Ever since net neutrality was repealed by the FCC in 2017, the foundation of the internet is at stake. If passed, S.4676 is passed, I would restore net neutrality, which would increase competition and innovation in the online space, as well as protect the freedom to say and use the internet. As a college student, the internet plays a huge role in my education, and this free and open access is and will continue to be at risk until net neutrality is reinstated. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you for your time and consideration.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sincerely,
        [Your Name]
        
    </p>
